Hi 👋! This is **Taz**. Welcome to my website 😊.

Currently, I am a postdoc in the [Cardiff NLP group](https://cardiffnlp.github.io/) working with [Prof Steven Schockaert](https://www.turing.ac.uk/people/turing-fellows/steven-schockaert) on efficient and scalable **graph representation** based methods for **reasoning**, **systematic generalization** and natural language understanding. On my quest to generally improve reasoning, I have also constructed **evals** to benchmark GNNs, LLMs and LRMs for graphical reasoning and researched **document level information retrieval**.

I also helped co-found and run a health tech company called [Gray Scrubs AI](https://www.grayscrubsai.com/) that provides mission-critical surgical and administrative compliance tools using on-edge, state-of-the-art vision and audio AI.

Before this, I was a quantum physicist and did my interdisciplinary PhD in **Quantum Control**, supervised by [Prof Edmond Jonckheere](https://ee.usc.edu/~jonckhee/) at [USC Viterbi](https://minghsiehece.usc.edu/) and [Carrie Weidner](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/qet-labs/research/weidner-group/) at [QET Labs](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/qet-labs/), Frank Langbein at Cardiff University and Sophie Schirmer. I got my undergraduate degree in Physics from [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/).

I also like to 🏃.
