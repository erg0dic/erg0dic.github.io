Hi üëã! This is **Taz**. Welcome to my website üòä. 

Currently, I am a postdoc in the [Cardiff NLP group](https://cardiffnlp.github.io/) working with [Prof Steven Schockaert](https://www.turing.ac.uk/people/turing-fellows/steven-schockaert) on efficient and scalable graph representation based methods for **reasoning** and natural language understanding. On my quest to improve reasoning algorithms, I have also constructed **evals** to benchmark GNNs, LLMs and LRMs for graphical reasoning and researched **document level information retrieval**.

Before this, I was a quantum physicist and did my interdisciplinary PhD in **Quantum Control** supervised by [Prof Edmond Jonckheere](https://ee.usc.edu/~jonckhee/) at [USC Viterbi](https://minghsiehece.usc.edu/) and [Dr. Carrie Weidner](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/qet-labs/research/weidner-group/) at [QET Labs](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/qet-labs/). I got my undergraduate degree in Physics from [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/). 

I also like üèÉ.
